# 610enC0de'd Password

## Briefing
Agents believe they have found a server belonging to a gang called the Yakoottees. If we can get access to it who knows what information we can gather on them! So far the Yakoottees have been very successful hiding their activities by encoding everything they do. We've found their server but don't have the password and so can't login. Can you help, intern? <br/>

**Tip**: Login to the server to get the flag.

## Solution

We can see that there is a flag design with the message in **ASCII** <br/>

`\x57\x65` <br/>
`\x6c\x63\x6f\x6d\x` <br/>
`65\x20\x74\x6f\x20\x74\x68` <br/>
`\x65\x20\x36\x31\x30\x65\x6e\x43\x30\x` <br/>
`64\x65\x20\x73\x65\x72\x76\x65\x72\x2e` <br/>
`\x20\x54\x68\x65\x20\x73\x65\x72\x76\x` <br/>
`65\x72\x20\x70\x61\x73\x73\x77\x6f\x72` <br/> 
`\x64\x20\x69\x73\x20\x34\x66\x31\x62\x` <br/>
`32\x35\x32\x30\x35\x35\x20\x2d\x20\x67` <br/>
`\x72\x65\x61\x74\x20\x64\x65\x63\x6f\x` <br/>
`64\x69\x6e\x67\x20\x42\x54\x57` <br/>
`\x2c\x20\x6c\x61\x74\` <br/>
`x65\x72\x7a\x21` <br/>

If we decode it, we get **"Welcome to the 610enC0de server. The server password is 4f1b252055 - great decoding BTW, laterz!"** <br/>
