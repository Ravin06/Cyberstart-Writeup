# Traffic Jam
## breifnging
Can you believe it, we think the Yakoottees are now planning to disrupt the flow of traffic in a major city! We need to find the URL of a forum they're using to communicate with each other. Can you figure out what the URL is?

Tip: Find the url of the forum to get the flag.

## sol
inspect the locked forum element with ctrl shift c or the cursor icon at the top left of the browser devtools

darn, something says disabled. change that to enabled

what, we can't still click on it, why don't we try clicking on something else

the url will change according to the page you have navigated to. for instance, from `https://trafficdisruptors.com` to `https://contact.trafficdisruptors.com`. It's a bit strange, because the subdomain shouldn't change like that... whatever. looking at the devtools, you can see the subdomain url name for each respective page. the forum one is "my-chat". so just add it to the front of the url: `https://my-chat.trafficdisruptors.com/`

a "bad user" error turns up. in the devtools, you should have seen a numerical string, looking at the Cycling Maps page shows this string at the back. So, append the forum string to the back of the earlier url: `https://my-chat.trafficdisruptors.com/312324494`

yup
