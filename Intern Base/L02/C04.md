# Start-Up Troubles
## briefing
A successful new start-up that sells electric scooters has discovered a handful of their customers' accounts have been hacked! And guess who we believe might be behind it? Yep, you've guessed it, the Yakoottees. Having only just entered the market and keen to maintain their otherwise excellent reputation, this business needs our help to run a security audit of their login system. Can you spot any security holes?

Tip: Successfully login to get the flag.

## sol

well, it's web, so pull out those devtools. inspect the submit button and look for any scripts being used. 

ooo would u look at that 
```javascript
            function doLogin (submittedEmail, submittedPassword) {
                var alertError = get('alert-error');

                if (submittedEmail !== email || submittedPassword !== password) {
                    alertError.style.display = 'block';
                    return;
                }

                executeLogin(submittedEmail, submittedPassword);
            }
        </script>
```

the function checks the inputs against an `email` variable and a `password` variable. These are variables, so we can find out what they are through the console with `console.log(email)` and `console.log(password)`

...or you could even just type `email` and `password` and the variable's value will show up.

enter in the login details and viola
