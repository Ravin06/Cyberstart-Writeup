# Spinlock
## Briefing
A large bank has refitted all of their vaults with the new SpinLock Extreme. As fancy as it sounds we believe it has a rather critical vulnerability, one we think the Yakoottees have been exploiting in a series of recent bank robberies.

The physical vault itself requires a special keycard to be inserted which, after checking the authenticity of the card, re-aligns the circular locking mechanism to unlock it and updates the interface to show it's unlocked. However, we believe that the organisation has been remote accessing the interface on the vault, and unlocking the vault by doing it in reverse: getting the interface to unlock, which unlocks the physical vault itself. If we can confirm the method, we'll be one step closer to understanding how this cyber gang operates!

Tip: Unlock the vault to get the flag.
## Sol

Inspect the spinning ring elements with `CTRL + SHIFT + C` or `CTRL + SHIFT + I`. Look just below those elements in the panel and you should find this javascript:

```javascript
                // Remind users of the number of degrees to use to unlock
                console.log("Set new degrees to unlock all circles between -81 and -4");
                // Identify our 3 circles
                var circles = ["one", "two", "three"];
                // Function to turn specified circle by number of degrees
                var turnCircle = function(num, deg) {
                    // Set rotation of the circle specified in num param
                    setTimeout(function() {
                        var ring = get('ring_'+num);
                        if (ring === null) return;
                        ring.style.transform = 'rotate('+deg+'deg)';
                    },0);

                    // For each of the circles
                    for (var i=0 ; i<circles.length; i++) {
                        // If not paused yet, slow circle down to a stop
                        if (get('ring_'+circles[i]).style.animationPlayState !== "paused") {
                            get('ring_'+circles[i]).style.animation = 'none';
                            get('ring_'+circles[i]).style.animationPlayState = 'paused';
                            get('ring_'+circles[i]).style.animationDuration = '0';

                            // Set other couple of circles rotation as well as one specified in num param
                            if (num !== circles[i]) {
                                setTimeout(function(x) {
                                    get('ring_'+circles[x]).style.transition = 'all 0.5s ease-in-out';
                                    get('ring_'+circles[x]).style.transform = 'rotate('+((x+1)*50)+'deg)';
                                },0,i);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
```

here we see we can use the function `turnCircle` in the developer's console to turn the rings. Go to the console tab and try a few values:

```javascript
turnCircle("one", -81)
```
amazing, the rings stopped moving and the red one moved. you can move it a little bit more to -70 degrees

either way you repeat for the other two rings, just trial and error

ring 2 is around -50 and ring 3 is around -20.

the knob thingy will drop down and the flag banner will appear

this is super unrealistic
