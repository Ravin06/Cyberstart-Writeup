# Social Engineering

## Briefing
Permission has been granted to try and log into the Chirp social media account of a hacker who goes by the name of D4YDR3AM. Luckily for us. they've been clumsy with their personal information. We know their dog's name is Barkley and they were born in 1993. Can you use what we know about them to guess their password and get us into their account? <br/>
**Tip**: Get the flag by guessing the correct password to sign into the account.

## Solution
Dogs name and Date of Birth is given <br/>
Combine them to get **"Barkley1993"**
