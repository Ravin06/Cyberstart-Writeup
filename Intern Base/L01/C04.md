# Lazy Locked Login

## Briefing
Our Dutch office recently bought a new Internet of Things (IoT) connected fridge. However, the temperature settings have been widely fluctuating as of late. All agents are currently out in the field and too busy to fix the problem. We know there is a remotely accessible technician's page where fridge settings can be modified, and that the fridge's login page isn't very secure. It was easy enough to find the username and password, but the form still has some very lazy extra protection. Intern, can you see if the rumours are true, fix our fridge, and help us verify this reported security vulnerability? <br/>

## Solution

Inspect element <br/>
We can see this piece of code <br/>
```<input id="submit-btn" type="submit" value="Enter" class="btn" disabled="">``` <br/>
We can change the **disabled** to **enabled** and then the button unlocks for us to press it and get the flag
