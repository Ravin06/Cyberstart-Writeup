#Hello World

##Briefing 
We've found a profile page of a known hacker that we need to get in contact with but most of the information visible on the page is useless to us. However, there is one secret real way to contact him that he's managed to inject on the page - a hidden email address. Intern, we need you to find his email address!
Tip: The email address is the flag.

##Solution
Inspect Element
