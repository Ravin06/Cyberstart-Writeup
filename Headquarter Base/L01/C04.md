# Race To Where

## Briefing
Here's an interesting one for you agent - on the weekend the gang released what looks like a one page website advertising an upcoming bike race they're organising. Being cyber detectives we're naturally curious that things might not be as they seem. Have a look at the site - it looks like there are just two images on the page, a logo and the poster, can you find anything suspicious, maybe some text?

Tip: Find the hidden clue and it'll lead you to the flag.

## Solution

First, we inspect the page <br/>
We can see a line, `<div class="quiet">Go to /secret.html</div>` <br/>
From there, we can see the flag, `Flag: ********************`
