# Happy Customers

## Briefing

During our initial analysis of the gang we noticed something strange - they created lists of their customers and shared it between their bike shops, and each customer had a unique pattern of numbers after their name. One of our agents thinks the pattern of numbers might be encoded words. We also noticed the numbers never went above 26, that might be relevant. Can you work out what it means?

Tip: Decode the message to get the secret word and use that as the flag.

## Solution

We can see none of the numbers exceed 26 and there are 26 letters in the alphabet. <br/>
So if we trace them to the alphabets we get: <br/>
`THE SECRET WORD IS WHEEL`
