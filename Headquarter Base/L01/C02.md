# Broken Banks

## Briefing
Agent, it looks like the gang are trying to raise some money to fund their plans - and they're doing so by sending fake banking emails to the customers of their bike shop to try and defraud them. Take a look at this email we intercepted, it's seemingly from a well known bank, but can you spot anything suspicious with it?<br/>

**Tip**: Click on the part of the suspicious email that makes you think it's fake and you'll get the flag.


## Solution

Click on the word `"accounts@cloudninebankk.com"` <br/>
There is a double "k"
