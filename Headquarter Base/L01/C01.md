# Social Secret

## Briefing
Agent, we think we might have a way to log into a social media account of one of the gang using the site's password reset form. We have two key pieces of information: his username and his favourite color. We just need his age and we'll be able to log in - can you guess it from the information we already have? <br/>

**Tip**: Get the age correct and submit the form to get the flag.

## Solution

We can see that the age the guy was born in was 1986 <br/>
So we can take the current year and subtract the birth year
