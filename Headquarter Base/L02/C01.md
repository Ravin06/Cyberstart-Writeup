# Decryption Ring

## Briefing
Things are really starting to get busy - the Slootmaekers seem to be in the final stages of preparing the heist, we need to move quickly! We've just received a message back from one of our undercover agents with details of where they're planning to start their heist. It's encrypted with a Caesar Cipher, but we can't remember what he said he was going to use as the offset and can't seem to get hold of him again. We've put the message into our Caesar Cipher decryption tool, see if you can use it to decrypt the text and read the message. <br/>

**Tip**: Decrypt the message by dragging the green slider, the flag is the name of the bike manufacturer.

## Solution
Keep dragging the slider <br/>
We can see the value of `14` works and we can see the message -- `GANG PLANNING HEIST TONIGHT AT VOLTRIDE`
