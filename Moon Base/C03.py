Briefing
'''
I hope you've been making notes agent as with this challenge you'll need to 
take what you've just learnt about variables and try converting the types of data they contain.

Oh, handy tip, if you make a bit of a mess with your code editor you can always click the reset 
button on the bottom right. It'll refresh the editor and put back the original text so you can start again.

Solution

carInfo = "Number of Doors: "
carDoors = 2

# CHALLENGE 1: Convert carDoors to a string using type conversion.
# Save it in a new variable: carDoorsString
carDoorsString = str(carDoors)

# CHALLENGE 2: Print out the number of doors in the car
# using print(carInfo + carDoorsString)
print(carInfo + carDoorsString)
